- based on the result, start to discuss and explore more about why its has the different result
- standardized the amount iteration and parameter being used
- collect and documented every result (x axis and the why axis) of the training and modeling from every algorithm in Excel or Sheet

which term of algorithm you want to highlight
- the complexity
- the accuracy
- the adaptability (?)
- the speed to get optimal result (?)
- the characteristic (compare to other)
- using (x) time cross validation -> looking for the standard deviation

dicsussion
- the trade off between accuracy and speed to get optimal result

presenting using ANOVA, Statistical Measurement

- coba gunakan lebih banyak iterasi (200, 300, 500, 1000)
- coba gunakan lebih sedikit iterasi (50, 30, 20)
- terapkan mlflow untuk tracking paramater

dicsussion
- the trade off between accuracy and speed to get optimal result

comparison
- comparing the mean, standard-deviation, best, worst of fitness score
